- **Local LLM Support**: Full Ollama integration (Llama 3.1, Mistral, etc.)
- **OpenAI Support**: Optional OpenAI integration for faster responses
- **Flexible Embedding**: Support for both Ollama and OpenAI embeddings
- **Document Loading**: PDF, TXT, DOCX, and web URL support
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB integration with persistent storage
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with JSON/console output
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions and retry mechanism with circuit breaker
- **Caching System**: In-memory cache with TTL for performance optimization
- **Metrics Collection**: Real-time performance monitoring
- **Input Validation**: Security-focused input sanitization
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based config with validation
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for core utilities
